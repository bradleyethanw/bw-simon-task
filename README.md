This is a game-like adaptation of the classic Simon Task intended for children around 5 years old (Simon, 1969). The Simon Effect referes to the phenomenon where people respond respond faster and more accurate to targets that occur in the same relative location as the response (congruent), and take more time and are less accurate when the target and location are different (incongruent). This is a test of cognitive flexibility written in Python using PsychoPy2 (Peirce et al., 2019).

This specific experiment used a LabHackers Millikey Response Box with a green left button and a red right button, mapped to the left and right arrow keys respectively. Lab streaming layer (LSL) was used to send triggers to NIRx fNIRS brain imaging, FLIR infrared thermal imaging, and Tobii infrared eye tracking.
